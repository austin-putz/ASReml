# ASReml

Things concerning ASReml. 

ASReml is software package for analyzing mixed models (such as PROC MIXED or lme4 in R). It can be used with different covariances such as <b>A</b> or <b>G</b> for example. 

You can download it from their <a href="https://www.vsni.co.uk/software/asreml/">website</a>. Hands down one of the worst software packages to download. They allow students to buy a copy for Windows only for 80 pounds (UK company). They are now limiting access for Linux users as well.
